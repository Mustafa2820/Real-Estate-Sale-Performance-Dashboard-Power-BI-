# Real Estate Sale Performance-Dashboard

"Real Estate Data plays a pivotal role in various business applications, offering valuable insights and opportunities across industries. I have developed a comprehensive Real Estate Sales Performance Dashboard that incorporates four key performance indicators (KPIs) â€” Sales, Target, Revenue, and Total Property. The dashboard includes insightful charts comparing sold properties vs. new properties on a monthly basis, providing a stage-wise property count, and illustrating total sales by states. Additionally, I've applied advanced data manipulation techniques using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for enhanced analytics.
